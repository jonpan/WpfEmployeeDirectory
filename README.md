# WpfEmployeeDirectory
.NET/WPF employee directory application.

A simple application that allows the user to add, edit and delete employee records.

Data is persistent in a SQL Server database called EmployeeDB and in a table called EmployeeInfo. The table has four fields , ID, firstName, lastName and startDate. 
The ID field is autogenerated, unique and is the primary index of the database. Enhancement would be to include a .sql file that generates the database and table 
to ensure compatibility


The database connection string is stored in a file located in "<Your Install Folder>\Application Files\WpfEmployeeDirectory_1_0_0_0" 
and is called "WpfEmployeeDirectory.exe.config.deploy". The section is shown below, replace with your string between <value> and </value> with no quotes.



  <applicationSettings>
    <WpfEmployeeDirectory.Properties.Settings>
      <setting name="DBConnectionString" serializeAs="String">
        <value>Data Source=DELL-FMQG6PQP5D\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=EmployeeDB;Integrated Security=True</value>
      </setting>
    </WpfEmployeeDirectory.Properties.Settings>
  </applicationSettings>


Enhancement: navigation around the DataGrid should center the window on the current selected employee such that after an update the edited or added employee
is always in view. The app does select the right employee but doesn't consistently place that entry in the visible part of the DataGrid.

Enhancement: search capabilities, specific employee, startDate window for reviews/anniversaries, service awards etc.

Enhancement: other data fields.
